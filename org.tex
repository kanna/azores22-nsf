\section{Organization \& conduct of the meeting}

The \symp will be organized in many ways traditionally and others
not. The critical item to note, is that the basic idea at this event is
to engage in ways that are direct. And to do so, in ways that can shape
nascent ideas that a speaker might want to present and one that might
not have been whetted before. Second, we do want speakers to engage not
their typical trusted peers, but those well outside their nominal
comfort zone. This does two things; one to articulate an idea/concept in
ways that is accessible. And two, it forces the ideation process to
bridge divides that tend to persist in typical siloed academic
settings. And we will do so, by asking every speaker to think about
technology -- if they're scientists. And to think science if they're
technologists. So for instance, if a technologist talks about making
water-column measurements, we would expect the challenger (and the
audience in turn) to poke and prod the speaker away from traditional
straight-line transects. That could (potentially) lead to discussion on
sampling strategies (and Sampling Theory), and in turn (and hopefully)
drive the speaker to a more curiosity driven approach to why and how the
biology (say) does what it does.
