\subsection{\nsf support request}

We are requesting \nsfe's support for a specific part of the \symp
costs. Namely funding for 3 Early Stage Researchers (ESRs) from
under-represented ocean facing nations in ocean sciences and
engineering. Our specific request for \nsf support is in Table
\ref{tab:esr-budget}.

    from \nsf for support for 3 ESRs at \sympe. Since ESRs could come
    from any of the Atlantic facing nation, travel costs are estimated.}

\subsubsection{Role of \air}

\air will be the host of the conference and the symposium will be
conducted, as a result, under their aegis. Their primary role will be
to receive funding support from various sources and to disburse
funding for symposium events and participants including travel,
boarding/lodging expenses. They will also aid in disseminating the
call for ESRs. The \air logo along with all sponsors of the symposium
will be displayed prominently on the event's web
pages\footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/view/oceanobs-advances/home}}.
